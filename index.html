				My primary research thrust is employing the power and flexibility of the 
				magnetohydrodynamic simulations to address forefront problems in astrophysics, for example, explaining the spin-down evolution of young, active stars; 
				modeling exoplanetary environments in order to assess their habitability; modeling the orbital evolution 
				of cataclysmic variables; and calibrating measurements of gyrochronology.
				My main interest is to address the challenging problem of spin-down evolution for young, active stars.</p>
