				<p>The orbital evolution of Cataclysmic Variables (CV) is governed by their angular momentum loss. While gravitational 
					radiation dominates for CVs in the short period regime, for periods longer than the period gap of ~3.2 hrs 
					this angular momentum loss is dominated by magnetic braking (angular momentum loss via magnetized winds). 				
					The usual prescription to study CVs orbital evolution via magnetic braking takes into account only the unevolved companion's winds assuming a dipolar field.  
					It has been shown that the WD magnetic field can have a significant effect on the winds structure 
					leading to a change of angular momentum loss rates of an order of magnitude.  In addition, the 
					complexity of the magnetic field can dramatically change stellar spin-down rates. 
					Magnetic morphology might explain the CV period gap as well.
One of the biggest problems of understanding CV evolution is understanding the period gap, the periods at which CVs are not observed. The current picture is that CVs evolve from the wherever they are born to the left hand side of this picture losing angular momentum through magnetized winds of the unevolved companion. This star loses mass through accretion and becomes later and later type. By the time they reach the right bound-

ary of the gap, this star has become fully convective. That led us to believe that there is a change in the dynamo responsible for this magnetic braking interruption. However, it has been recently shown by Wright and Drake in a paper in Nature, that the X-ray observed properties of fully convective stars are identical to those of the solar-like stars and, therefore, magnetic prop- erties should be the same. How does, then, this interruption in magnetic braking work?
