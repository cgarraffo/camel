## CfA Proposals:

### PI: Razieh Emami

Recent studies show that MW galaxies from the cosmological simulations of the TNG are twisted. What drives the galaxy rotation remains elusive and must be connected to the galaxy evolution and the impact of the mergers. A first look at the redshift evolution of galaxies demonstrates that the galaxy type is changed over the time and there are also some levels of the noise there. In this work, we aim to use some machine learning approach to trace the galaxy shape evolution over the cosmic time and figure out the main drivers of the galaxy rotation.

## Painting gas onto dark-matter-only simulations with neural nets

### PI: Urmila Chadayammuri

As we understand it today, most of the matter in the Universe is dark, i.e. it only interacts with anything else via gravity. On the other hand, everything that we see is normal, or baryonic, matter. In galaxy clusters, large groups of thousands of galaxies, the space between galaxies is filled with a plasma (ionised gas). This plasma does know about the gravity of the dark matter in the region, but also experiences other physics, like cooling and heating, which are far more complicated. We can test different models of dark matter by looking at the statistics of galaxy clusters. Simulating large numbers of these with all the gas physics is currently computationally infeasible. Instead, we have large suites of dark-matter-only simulations, which only have to solve the equation of gravity, and then smaller simulations which simulate all the gas physics as well but don't have enough statistics for cosmology. I would like to teach ML to "learn" from the smaller simulations how to "paint" gas onto the dark-matter-only simulations. 
My input is 2D maps of the projected dark-matter quantities on the one hand, and corresponding 2D maps of the gas on the other. After training, the model should be able to read in other maps of dark matter, and predict what the gas would look like (i.e. what telescopes would see). Currently I am struggling with getting the neural net to capture the smallest, brightest regions.

## Classifying Variable Stars from SDSS-IV

### PI: Paul Green

The SDSS-IV Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) obtained SDSS optical spectroscopy for about 11000 variable stars.  We have characterized numerous variability attributes from ZTF light curves, absolute magnitudes and Galactic position from Gaia, and the spectral type from SDSS.  We want to classify as many variables into physical types as possible.  We are developing training sets from the literature and from our own visual inspection.  About half the stars show periodic variability and are most easily classified.  Non-periodic variable stars may be irregular, poorly-sampled, or exotic.
